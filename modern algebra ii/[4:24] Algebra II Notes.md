#### Review

Take some $A : R^m \to R^n$ where 

**Theorem:** Using row and column operations, we c an reduce it to some $A'$ as follows such that $d_1 \mid d_2, \; d_2 \mid d_3, \; \dots, \; d_{n-1} \mid d_n$.

**Proof:** Use GJ elimination and division with remainder (where we assume $a_n$​ is minimal, non-zero in the first column).

For any $i$-th row, we subtract (1st row) $\cdot \frac{a_{i1}}{a_{11}}$, with the latter being hte integral part. This means that the new $i$-th row looks like
$$
[r \mid \cdots \cdot \cdots \;]
$$
where $a_{i1} = \lfloor \frac{a_{i1}}{a_{11}}\rfloor a_{11} + r$ where $r < a_{11}$, then if $r \neq 0$, we replace the first row with the $i$-th row. 

Repeating this for each $i > 1$ and while $a_{i1} \neq 0$, we can reduce $A$ to

By column operations, we can reduce the matrix to

Apply the same process to $M^{(2)} = \begin{pmatrix} a_{i2}^{(2)} & \cdots \\ \vdots & \ddots \end{pmatrix}$ . if $a_{22}^{(2)}$ is not divislbe by $a_{11}^{(2)}$, the proof will be finished later.

**Remark:** $A' = Q^{-1}AP$ wherE $Q^{-1}, P$ are invertible (as $\mathbb{Z}$-matrices) of sizes $n \times n$ and $m \times m$ respectively. Consider the diagram,

Retruning to the problem of solving $Ax = b$ in integers, consider the hommogenous equation $Ax = 0 \iff QA'P^{-1}x = 0$, defining $x' = P^{-1}x$, we have $Ax = 0 \iff A'x' = 0$ where $x' = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \\ x_{k+1} \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{pmatrix}$ with the number of zeroes being $k$. 

Furthermore, the $\Im(A) = \Im(QA') = Q\Im(A')$ where $\Im(A') = \{c_1d_1e_1 + \cdots + c_kd_ke_k\}$ where $c_1, \dots, c_k \in \mathbb{Z}$. 

**Corollary:** Let $V$ be a free finitely generated $\mathbb{Z}$-modu;le and $W \subset V$ be its submodule. Then, $W$ is also free of rank smaller than $\rank(V)$. 

**Proof:** Choose a basis $\{v_1, \dots, v_n\}$ of $V$ and generating set $\{w_1, \dots, w_m\}$ of $W$. Consider the diagram,

where $A$ is the matrix defined as ta composition $C^{-1} \circ i \circ B$ and the map $\mathbb{Z}^m \to W$ is surjective. By the previous theorem, we can change bases in $\mathbb{Z}^m$ and $\mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $A'$ is as follows.

Then, $w_1', \dots w_k'$ generate $W$ and are independent $\implies$ they are a basis of $W$. 

<u>Example:</u> Consider $\mathbb{Z}^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. 

What is the set of all points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ generated by $w_1, w_2, w_3$? If the set of points is a $\mathbb{Z}$-submodule of $\mathbb{Z}^2 \implies $ it is free submodule of $\rank \;2$. To get a basis of the sublattice, we form $A = [w_1w_2w_3]$ and diagonalize it!

#### Presentation of Modules

Let $V$ be an $R$-module and $\{v_1, \dots v_n\}$ be a generating set of $V$. The generating set defines a homomorphism $R^n \to_{\phi} V$. 

Let $W = \text{Ker}(\phi)$, it is also an $R$-module. Assume $W$ is finitely generated (there exist a generating set $\{w_1,\dots, w_n \}$ of $W$ ). Consider the following diagram of $R$-modules.

<img src="/Users/connorli/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/Screenshot 2024-04-24 at 3.34.55 PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-24 at 3.34.55 PM" style="zoom:25%;" />

Let $A = B \circ i$ be an $n \times m$ matrix. By the first homomorphism theorem for $R$ modules,
$$
\Im(\phi) \cong R^n / \text{Ker}(\phi) \implies V \cong R^n / AR^m
$$
**Remark:** If $c_1v_1 + \cdots + c_nv_n = 0 \in V$, then $\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\ \vdots \\ c_n\end{pmatrix}$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$. 

**Definition:** $A \in \text{Mat}_{n \times m}(R)$ is called a <u>presentation matrix</u> of $V$ if $V \cong R^n / AR^m$. 

**Remark:** Any finitely generated $R$-module with finitely generated module of relations has a presentation matrix.

<u>Example:</u> Let $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ be a $\mathbb{Z}$-module $1\in \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is a generating vector $\mathbb{Z} \to^{\phi} \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ where $k \to [k]$. 

- $\text{Ker}(\phi) = n\mathbb{Z}$ 
- If $W \cong \mathbb{Z}$, $A = 1 \times 1$ matrix $n$ 

**Theorem:** (Classification of finitely generated abelian groups) Let $V$ be a finitely generated $\mathbb{Z}$-module, then $V \cong Cd_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus Cd_k \oplus \mathbb{Z}^r$, where $Cd_i \cong \mathbb{Z}/d_i\mathbb{Z}$ and $d_1 \mid d_2, \; \dots, \;d_{k-1} | d_k$ for $r \geq 0$​.

---

**Remark:** Let $V_1, V_2 \subset V$ be submodules of an $R$-module $V$. 

**Definition:** $V_1 + V_2 \subset V$ is a submodule defined by $v_1 + v_2 = \{r_1v_1 + r_2v_2\;:\; v_1 \in V_1, v_2\in V_2, r_1,r_2 \in R\}$. 

We say that $V \cong V_1 \oplus V_2$ if $v_1 + v_2 = 0 \implies v_1 = v_2 = 0$. 

---

**Proof of Theorem:** First, let's start with a fact.

<u>Fact:</u> Let $R$ be a ring such that every ideal $I \subset R$ is finitely generated (such $R$ are called Noetherian) $\implies$ any submodule of a finitely generated $R$-module is finitely generated. 

<u>Example:</u> Any PID is Noetherian. 

**Corollary:** Any finitely generated $\mathbb{Z}$-module has a presentation. $V \cong \mathbb{Z}^n / A\mathbb{Z}^m$ for some $A \in \text{Mat}_{n\times m}(\mathbb{Z})$.
